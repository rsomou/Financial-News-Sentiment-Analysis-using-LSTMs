# Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTMs

Created and analyzed a sequential model consisting of a multidimensional word embedding layer connected to an LSTM layer to a dense NN layer to predict the sentiment of clusters of words in news articles. I used LSTMs to preserve context and long-term dependencies to more accurately depict the sentiment of the entire message that was inputted and trained a Doc2Vec model on the training data to gather embeddings more closely associated with the context we desired.
